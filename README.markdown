# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: second application (1st Edition)

This is the second application from
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Micheal Hart](http://michaelhart.com/).

Please not that this is from the 1st edition of the tutorial and that I am now trying the second edtion.
Checkout that repo for more info.

This is the work from Chapter 3 onwards.

This is David Rankin's attempt at the tutorial (don't laugh too much)
