# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: second application

This is the second application from
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Micheal Hart](http://michaelhart.com/).

This is the work from Chapter 3 onwards.

This is David Rankin's attempt at the tutorial (don't laugh too much)
